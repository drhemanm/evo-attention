# Limitations

This document honestly describes what EvoAttention does NOT do, and what caveats apply to our results.

## Scale Limitations

### ❌ Small Models Only

**What we tested:**
- 2 layers
- 128 dimensions
- 4 attention heads
- ~500K parameters

**What we DIDN'T test:**
- 6+ layer models
- 768+ dimensions
- 100M+ parameter models
- GPT/BERT scale (billions of parameters)

**Why this matters:** Small model results often don't transfer to large models. What works at 500K params might fail at 1B params.

**Example:** Many NAS techniques work great on CIFAR-10 but fail on ImageNet.

### ❌ Limited Training

**What we did:**
- 5,000 training steps per model
- Single learning rate (3e-4)
- No learning rate schedule
- No advanced optimization

**What we DIDN'T do:**
- Train to full convergence (would need 50K+ steps)
- Hyperparameter tuning per mechanism
- Learning rate search
- Advanced techniques (warmup, cosine decay, etc.)

**Why this matters:** We measure relative performance at 5K steps, not final converged performance. Rankings might change with more training.

## Dataset Limitations

### ❌ Single Dataset

**What we tested:**
- WikiText-2 only
- English language only
- 103M tokens
- Word-level tokenization

**What we DIDN'T test:**
- Other language modeling datasets (Penn Treebank, Enwik8)
- Other languages
- Other modalities (vision, audio, multimodal)
- Byte-level or BPE tokenization

**Why this matters:** Results might be specific to WikiText-2's characteristics. The "best" mechanism might not work on Chinese text or protein sequences.

### ❌ Single Task

**What we tested:**
- Language modeling (next token prediction)

**What we DIDN'T test:**
- Classification
- Question answering
- Machine translation
- Image recognition
- Speech recognition

**Why this matters:** Attention mechanisms might need to be different for different tasks.

## Statistical Limitations

### ❌ Single Run Per Mechanism

**What we did:**
- Trained each mechanism once
- Used seed=42 throughout

**What we DIDN'T do:**
- Multiple runs with different seeds
- Statistical significance testing
- Confidence intervals
- Variance analysis

**Why this matters:** With training variance of ±1 perplexity, we can't be sure if a 0.5 point improvement is real or luck.

**Example:** 
- Mechanism A: 98.5 perplexity (one run)
- Mechanism B: 98.8 perplexity (one run)

Is A really better? Unknown without multiple runs.

### ❌ No Baseline Tuning

**What we did:**
- Used default hyperparameters for baseline
- Gave evolved mechanisms 120+ attempts to optimize

**What we DIDN'T do:**
- Tune baseline transformer hyperparameters
- Give baseline the same number of trials
- Fair computational budget comparison

**Why this matters:** With enough tries, random search can find good hyperparameters. Did we discover better mechanisms or just better hyperparameters?

## Search Space Limitations

### ❌ Limited Coverage

**Search space size:** 384+ discrete combinations

**Evaluated:** 93 mechanisms (~24% coverage)

**Not explored:**
- 76% of the search space
- Combinations of 3+ advanced features
- Continuous hyperparameter optimization
- Architecture features beyond attention

**Why this matters:** Many good mechanisms were never tried. We found a local optimum, not necessarily the global optimum.

### ❌ Fixed Architecture

**What we fixed:**
- Number of layers (2)
- Model dimension (128)
- FFN structure (4×expansion)
- Embedding strategy

**What we DIDN'T search:**
- Layer-specific attention (different per layer)
- Hybrid mechanisms (mix different types)
- Architecture parameters
- Training strategies

**Why this matters:** The "best" attention might depend on the overall architecture.

## Computational Limitations

### ❌ No Efficiency Metrics

**What we optimized:**
- Perplexity only

**What we DIDN'T consider:**
- Training speed (FLOPs)
- Inference speed
- Memory usage
- Hardware utilization
- Carbon footprint

**Why this matters:** A 1% perplexity improvement that takes 10× longer is not practical.

**Example:** Sparsemax might be slower than softmax on GPUs despite better accuracy.

### ❌ Limited Compute Budget

**Total compute used:**
- ~120 model trainings
- ~20 GPU hours (free Colab)
- ~$50 worth of compute at cloud prices

**Not accessible:**
- Large-scale NAS (1000s of models)
- Multi-task evaluation
- Long training runs
- Architecture search at scale

**Why this matters:** With more compute, we might find much better mechanisms.

## Methodological Limitations

### ❌ No Causal Analysis

**What we know:**
- Mechanism X achieves perplexity Y

**What we DON'T know:**
- WHY mechanism X works
- WHEN it will work (other settings)
- HOW it compares to theory

**Why this matters:** Without understanding WHY, we can't predict when results will transfer.

### ❌ No Ablation Studies

**What we DIDN'T test:**
- Individual component contributions
- Component interactions
- Necessity of each feature
- Sufficient conditions for improvement

**Why this matters:** Is sparsemax + output gating necessary? Or would either alone work?

### ❌ Limited Comparison

**What we compared to:**
- Vanilla transformer only

**What we DIDN'T compare to:**
- Linear attention
- Performer
- Flash Attention
- Reformer
- Longformer
- Big Bird
- Other efficient attention variants

**Why this matters:** Our "winner" might still be worse than existing methods we didn't test.

## Reproducibility Limitations

### ❌ Training Variance

**Observed variance:** ±1 perplexity for same mechanism, different seeds

**Implications:**
- Results are noisy
- Rankings can change
- Statistical tests needed

**Example from our run:**
- Gen 0: multiplicative|relu_norm → 100.37
- Gen 3: multiplicative|relu_norm → 99.58
- Same mechanism, 0.8 point difference!

### ❌ Hardware Dependence

**Tested on:**
- Google Colab (free tier)
- NVIDIA Tesla T4
- CUDA 11.x

**Unknown:**
- Results on different GPUs
- CPU performance
- TPU compatibility
- Apple Silicon (MPS)

**Why this matters:** Numerical precision and optimization can vary across hardware.

## Practical Limitations

### ❌ Not Production Ready

**This code is NOT:**
- ✗ Battle-tested
- ✗ Optimized for speed
- ✗ Memory efficient
- ✗ Fault tolerant
- ✗ Well documented (yet)
- ✗ API stable

**This code IS:**
- ✓ Research prototype
- ✓ Proof of concept
- ✓ Educational tool

### ❌ No Deployment Guide

**Not provided:**
- How to deploy evolved models
- How to integrate with existing systems
- How to serve at scale
- How to monitor in production

### ❌ Limited Documentation

**Missing:**
- API reference
- Tutorial videos
- Example notebooks (coming soon)
- Troubleshooting guide

## Theoretical Limitations

### ❌ No Theoretical Guarantees

**We don't prove:**
- Convergence properties
- Optimality guarantees
- Generalization bounds
- Sample complexity

**Why this matters:** This is empirical research, not theoretical. No guarantees about what will happen in other settings.

### ❌ Limited Understanding

**Open questions:**
- Why does sparsemax work better?
- Why does highway gating fail?
- What's the relationship between components?
- Are there better mechanisms we missed?

## Comparison Limitations

### ❌ Unfair Baseline

**Potential issues:**
- Baseline uses default hyperparameters
- Evolved mechanisms get 120+ tries
- No hyperparameter tuning for baseline
- Compute budget is unequal

**Fair comparison would require:**
- Tuning baseline with same compute budget
- Random search baseline
- Bayesian optimization baseline

### ❌ Cherry-Picking Risk

**We report:** Best mechanism across all generations

**Not reported:** 
- How many failed worse than baseline?
- Distribution of results
- Worst mechanisms

**Why this matters:** Reporting only the best can be misleading.
